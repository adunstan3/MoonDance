# Builds the app and opens it on YOUR simulator, the one you watch in DeviceHub,
# with no debugger attached.
# Usage: scripts/open.sh [--no-launch] [launch args…]   (USER_SIM_NAME=... for another watch)
#   --no-launch  build and install without bringing the app to the front, so the
#                watch keeps showing whatever app is open. If this app was the one
#                in front, installing closes it, so it is launched again. Run it this
#                way at the end of every turn that changes the app.
